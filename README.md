The project involves building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features like brand reputation, specifications, and performance metrics. This is a practical application of regression analysis and a valuable project for learning predictive modeling in machine learning.

Project Summary:

	1.	Objective:
	•	To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a car based on input features.
	•	To understand the relationship between car features and their impact on pricing.
	2.	Data Collection:
	•	Gather data from sources like Kaggle, automotive websites, or dealership records.
	•	Include features such as car brand, model, manufacturing year, engine type, horsepower, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and safety features.
	3.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handle missing values and outliers.
	•	Convert categorical features (e.g., brand, fuel type) into numerical representations using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding.
	•	Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.
	4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Visualize correlations between car price and features using heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots.
	•	Analyze trends like the impact of brand reputation or engine power on pricing.
	5.	Model Selection and Training:
	•	Use regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost).
	•	Train the model using a portion of the dataset and validate it using cross-validation.
	6.	Model Evaluation:
	•	Assess the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared score.
	•	Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters.
	7.	Deployment (Optional):
	•	Create a user interface or deploy the model as an API where users can input car features to get price predictions.
	8.	Conclusion:
	•	Summarize key insights, such as which features most influence car prices.
	•	Highlight the accuracy and potential applications of the model in the automotive industry.
